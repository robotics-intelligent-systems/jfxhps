# Hybrid Propulsion System

ModelFLOWs is a research group at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (Spain), School of Aerospace Engineering, specializing in data analysis, reduced order modeling, machine learning, artificial intelligence and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The 40KG Forced Turbojet Engine is a cutting-edge micro gas turbine producing 40 kilograms of thrust in a compact form factor. This is the library of general components of thermo-fluid and thermodynamic system modeling. This is the library of thermo-fluid and thermodynamic calculation components mainly for modeling of aircraft's propulsion system. A modular and flexible hydrogen transport aircraft concept involves designing aircraft with interchangeable parts and adaptable propulsion systems. The Advanced Geared Turbofan 30,000 lbf Electrified (AGTF30-e) is an electrified geared turbofan that leverages the previously developed AGTF30 model. T-MATS is a Simulink toolbox designed for use in modeling and simulating thermodynamic systems and their controls. The OpenAP aircraft performance model is an open-source initiative designed to enhance air transport research. OpenVSP is a parametric aircraft geometry tool. The Aviary is an open-source code repository is an aircraft design, analysis, and optimization tool built on top of the Python-based optimization framework OpenMDAO. Chrono is an open-source multi-physics simulation framework used to investigate fluid-solid interaction problems and the dynamics of large systems of rigid and/or flexible bodies
